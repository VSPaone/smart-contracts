# **Smart Contracts without Blockchain Dependency**

### Overview

**Smart Contracts** is a Node.js-based application that allows the creation, validation, and execution of smart contracts without relying on blockchain technology. It features a distributed architecture with nodes, events, and state management, providing a scalable and secure solution for contract automation.

## Features

- **Decentralized Smart Contracts**: Create and manage contracts without the need for blockchain technology.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Events trigger contract actions and state changes dynamically.
- **State Management**: Synchronizes state across distributed nodes for consistency.
- **Security**: Implements JWT-based authentication, encryption, and role-based access control.
- **Scalable and Extensible**: Easily add nodes and scale horizontally for distributed systems.

## Architecture

The application uses a modular architecture with the following main components:

1. **API Layer**: Exposes endpoints for managing contracts, nodes, and events.
2. **Contracts**: Handles the creation, validation, execution, and logging of smart contracts.
3. **Nodes**: Manages node registration, health monitoring, and state synchronization.
4. **Events**: Manages the triggering and processing of events within the system.
5. **State Management**: Ensures consistent state synchronization across nodes.
6. **Security**: Provides authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure access.

For a more detailed overview of the architecture, please refer to the [Architecture Overview](public/docs/Architecture_Overview.md).

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14+)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **MongoDB** (for local or remote database)
- **Docker** (optional, for Docker-based deployment)

### Installation

There are two ways to install the application:

#### 1. Installing via npm

If you prefer to install the application as an npm package, run:

```bash
npm install smartcontracts.js
```

#### 2. Cloning the Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VSPaone/smart-contracts.git
   cd smart-contracts
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory (refer to the [development.env](public/docs/development.env), [production.env](public/docs/production.env), and [test.env](public/docs/test.env) files for examples).

4. **Run the Application**:
   - For development:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - For production:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Deployment Guide

The application can be deployed using Docker or directly on a cloud platform. For a step-by-step guide, refer to the [Deployment Guide](public/docs/Deployment_Guide.md).

### Docker Deployment

To build and run the application using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Traditional Deployment

If you prefer not to use Docker, the guide provides instructions for setting up the application manually on your server.

## API Documentation

The API documentation provides a comprehensive overview of all available endpoints, including request and response formats. Refer to the [API Documentation](public/docs/API_Documentation.md) for detailed information.

## Usage Guide

Learn how to create, manage, and execute contracts, as well as manage nodes and events, by consulting the [Usage Guide](public/docs/Usage_Guide.md).

## Testing

The application uses **Mocha** and **Chai** for testing, and you can run tests using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

Make sure you have the testing environment set up (refer to [test.env](public/docs/test.env)).
